## 🧠 Project Overview

This project consists of the faithful implementation of a professional graphic design provided by a UI/UX designer.  
My role focused entirely on **front-end development**, ensuring that the visual design was accurately translated into clean, responsive, and maintainable code.

The result is a modern, scalable, and user-friendly website built with best practices in mind.
