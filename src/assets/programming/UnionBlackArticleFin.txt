As children of first‑generation immigrants, many of us are more familiar with life in the UK than we are with our heritage countries. As a result, an identity crisis is almost unavoidable, regardless of the effort our parents have put into ensuring we are proud of where we come from. For those of us who have previously, or are yet to experience this crisis The Union Black can be seen as a source of comfort. It symbolises recognition that being a part of this combination of characteristics is deserving of attention as this is a reality for much of the population. It serves as a single visual representation of our families’ histories, the struggles faced by Afro‑Caribbean people in Britain today, the pride we feel in our background, the love we have for the places we call home, and the duality of belonging to both cultures in different ways.

Naturally, by the time we reach adulthood, we develop a heightened awareness of the injustices and difficulties that led our families to seek opportunities elsewhere. This awareness exists alongside gratitude for the opportunities and privileges afforded to us by living in what has long been considered a “first‑world” country. However, the same system that provides this privilege also produces social dynamics that make us feel like unwelcome visitors, despite being born here or having lived here since infancy. We are then tasked with developing a healthy sense of self while navigating these external influences.

It should be noted that a large portion of the Black British population is Caribbean. This community has had a strong presence in the UK for many years and is now multiple generations deep. Their influence is well understood and well documented. In contrast, African immigrants are relatively newer, and while the experiences of these two communities may differ slightly, there are inevitably enough shared realities to justify discussing them together.

It begins in primary school, experiences here are often limited to seemingly harmless questions that can be attributed to childish innocence and curiosity: “Are your bones black too?” or “Why are your palms a different colour from the rest of you?” These are the kinds of questions we may excuse later in life when reflecting as adults. However, it is important to consider their impact in the moment, when the recipient is still a child. The assumed innocence does not negate the fact that such interactions can mark the first instance of a potentially dangerous thought “I am not like them”.

As time goes on, depending on one’s experiences, this realisation may be accepted as a simple fact of life or may develop into a root of deep‑seated shame, the latter being tragically common. This moment marks the planting of the seed of being othered, which, if left unchecked, can grow into a harmful ideology. It’s likely that the child experiencing this has little to no awareness of the effect it’s having on their subconscious.

Secondary school then arrives, marking the beginning of adolescence. The most emotionally delicate stage of life spent among peers who are equally neurologically malleable. Even in a best‑case scenario, where an individual appreciates their skin tone and genetic makeup despite limited familiarity with their cultural background, they will have this self‑acceptance inevitably tested. Prior to this stage, their race may not have felt like something that demanded constant attention. Tragically they will soon be forced into a state of hyper‑awareness.

Lessons on slavery prompt lingering glances. Civil rights discussions bring the same reaction. When poverty in Africa is discussed and a teacher mentions the country you or your family are from, the attention becomes unavoidable. Then comes overt racism. When a monkey appears in class, you brace yourself for a comment or a snide look. A Neanderthal, a prehistoric human, or anything brown evokes the same response. You are unequipped for this. You never anticipated having to navigate such situations. You attempt to challenge them, but after repeated incidents with no meaningful outcome, you learn to pick your battles.

Even teachers often fail to take appropriate action. Their discomfort is visible, and their responses are inadequate. This inaction deepens frustration and reinforces a sense of abandonment within the very spaces meant to educate and protect.

Although this period takes a considerable toll, it is not entirely without relief. You have friends, and that helps. However, even this comes with it’s own challenges. What was once described as childish innocence is not outgrown at the same pace as preadolescence, instead, it hardens into ignorance. While you know your friends are not racist in intent, it becomes painfully evident that many of them have spent their lives almost exclusively, sometimes entirely, surrounded by people who look like them and think like them. They have lived a life that has left them completely unaware of the complicated experiences faced by ethnic groups. As a result, they move through life with a misplaced confidence in their problematic thinking. This confidence extends so far that they feel entitled to tell you what is and is not offensive, and how you should or should not react. You can attempt to challenge these views, but you quickly realise you are alone, positioned against an entire social group drawn from a demographic you are not part of. The more you push back against their rhetoric, the more isolated you become. You are forced to choose between maintaining a social life or committing to social activism. At your age, it is understandable that you may choose the former, becoming selective about which issues you confront and disengaging from those you feel are not worth the emotional cost. It is a decision that leaves you conflicted, as either choice carries its own dissatisfaction. The realisation that even your closest friends are capable of a level of ignorance you assumed proximity alone would prevent leads to uncomfortable reflections on social dynamics surrounding race, and often class as well. 

At this point, the initial seed of othering has been nurtured into something far more entrenched within your psyche. You begin yearning for a sense of kinship, an understanding and belonging that must come from somewhere beyond your family. You’ve reached the peak of your frustration and exhaustion from prolonged exposure to ignorance. The volcano within you erupts into an aggressively pro black era of your life. When analysing your new found obsession with black revolutionaries and radicalism, it’s hard to tell how much of this is overcompensating for feeling you didn’t fight hard enough up until now. Over time you’ll slowly begin to level out as you heal from your past experiences. You’ll reach a point where you hold the same values you always have, except, with your reactionary mind state replaced with a calm and intentional approach. However, for now anger rightfully has its place as a necessary step towards healing from what you’ve previously experienced. The duration of this intense stage of overcoming and becoming varies from person to person, but it shall remain present for as long as it needs to.

Leaving school presents itself as an opportunity to step away from your previous social circle and seek out a community of people who share your complexion. You do not stay on for year thirteen. Sixth form ends… college begins. During this time, your two closest friends are Nigerian and Bajan, you will feel seen in a way that is entirely new. What you do not anticipate, however, is that you will also be misunderstood in unfamiliar ways. This misunderstanding does not come from those pre established friends, but from the wider college community. To them, you are a new entity, someone with a familiar skin tone but an unfamiliar character. They categorise you using the limited frameworks available to them, even when those conclusions are wildly inaccurate.

This is the point at which the experience of moving from a majority‑white environment into a majority‑Black enlightens you to a specific phenomenon. Often summarised as being “too Black for the white kids and too white for the Black kids,” although not new, it wouldn’t be irrational to say this reality remains poorly understood across all racial groups, even when replacing black with their respective race. What follows is the imposition of expectations that do not align with you. These expectations dictate how you should behave, speak, and present yourself, and are placed upon you by peers who share your skin tone. You may not realise it immediately but at some point, either during this period or after it’s over, you’ll come to understand how this happens. After assessing yourself and your peers you’ll eventually see how environment plays a key role in shaping who you are, who you believe you can become and how you expect or allow others to present themselves.

Unfortunately, we must acknowledge that this identity policing can fuel powerful insecurity for anyone subjected to it. Feeling different from those who neither look like you nor share your background is one thing. Realising that those you expected to relate to most also view you as different creates a deeper and more destabilising internal conflict. At its worst, this can lead you to believe that you must change in order to present yourself in a manner you feel will be more respected. It’s well understood this is almost never the right solution towards social problems and it’s especially true here. In reality these imposed expectations are shaped by what’s familiar to a group of people to whom you are unfamiliar. You will never make adequate adjustments to be seen and accepted in the way you’re attempting and any efforts to do so are met with discomfort from them as well as within yourself. Their capacity to accept identities beyond their lived experience is influenced by factors largely outside your control, and often beyond theirs as well.

If you are fortunate enough to be exposed to the right information and interacting with the right people, there may come a point at which you are able to process these experiences with a healthier mindset. You may reach a state in which you no longer believe you can be othered in the way you once were. The world contains far more types of people than the teenage version of yourself was ever prepared for. Yes, you will differ from some people in certain ways, but this is an ordinary feature of life you will grow accustomed to. There are others with whom you will share meaningful similarities, people who will love you in new ways and frustrate you in new ways just the same. The key lies in forming your identity by choosing it for yourself, by relating to every aspect of yourself first. Viewing your life with understanding and compassion, and recognising both who you are and why you are, allows you to accept yourself fully. This acceptance frees you from the shame carried as a result of believing you were too much of one thing and not enough of something else. In this sense, the Union Black serves as a reminder that your existence is not the problem as there are many people just like you even if not in your immediate vicinity.

Thus far, this discussion has focused on experiences viewed through a microscopic lens. However, broader societal messages are continuously communicated on multiple levels. Media often reinforces the idea that you are too ethnic to fully belong in Britain, while simultaneously suggesting that you are not enough of something else to belong to ethnic communities that also occupy the U.K. It’s an assault from all directions, producing a desperate desire for every part of your identity to be treated with the respect it deserves.

Many of us were born here. We understand British references, the nuances of the English language, the dryness of British humour, and we love a Sunday roast as much as anyone else. We are as deeply British as anyone who has spent a comparable amount of time here. Yet even in the smallest social interactions, we are made to feel othered from the moment we are old enough to recognise it. At the same time, we take pride in the genetics we have been blessed with and remain deeply protective of our heritage, culture, and history. This cannot be overstated. Nevertheless it’s from people who we stand beside in these communities that seek to invalidate this facet of our identity.

For those who recognise themselves in this discussion, it is important to understand that everything you have experienced has contributed to your identity. You are the sum of all of it. It’s more than acceptable to be a mixture of things that may not be reflected in the people around you. Your life is your own, and while you may occupy certain categories, you also redefine them, they do not define you. The way this complexity manifests in your character should be embraced as a valid and enriching addition to any community you’re a part of. There is no singular way you are required to present yourself to the world. You are the product of all your experiences and those who came before you, and this reality does not need to be understood by everyone, nor explained to those unwilling to understand it.
