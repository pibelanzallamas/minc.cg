    For those of us that have reached adulthood having gone through an inebvitable
    identity crisis, the union black is a comforting sight to behold. It recognises the duality
    in being of African/Caribbean descent, while spending most of your life in a colonial 
    country. As children of first-generation immigrants many of us are more familiar with
    the UK than we are out heritage countries, each aspect of an identity shaped by such
    a circumstance is to be valued in its own right as there is much to admire about both
    parts. Naturally by the time we reach adulthood we are equipped with a sensitive
    awareness of the injustice and difficulties that led our families to seek opportunities
    elsewhere. In combination with gratitude that acknowledges the opportunities and
    privilege given to us as a result of living inside of what has been considered a 'first
    world' country. However, the same hand that feeds us such privilege also delivers us
    social dynamics that allows us to feel we are visitors and, in some cases, unwelcome
    visitors despite being born here or having lived here since infancy. We are then
    tasked with developing a healthy sense of self while in the midst of these external 
    influences. An identity crisis is almost unavoidable regardless of the effort or parents
    have put in to make sure we are proud of where we come from (which we are). The
    union black is a symbol of recognition that being a part of this mix of characteristics is
    noteworthy in itself it's existence, is an immediate scream of it's necessity whether we 
    speak of it or not. A single visual representation of the history of our families, the 
    struggles faced by afro/Caribbeans in Britain today, the pride we feel for out
    background, the love we feel for where our homes reside, and the duality of being a 
    part of both cultures in different ways.`,
    `It should be noted that a large portion of the black British population are Caribbean.
    As we know already they've had a strong presence in the UK for years now and are 
    two or three possibly four generations deep. Their influence has been well 
    understood and well documented. On the flip side the African immigrants are 
    relatively new in comparison so the experiences between these two communities
    may differ slightly but overall it's safe to say there is inevitably enough
    similarities to pair them together.`,
    `Let's start from the beginning. For the most part, primary school doesn't involve much
    more than a few harmless questions that we can chalk up to childish innocence and
    curiosity. "Are your bones black too?" "Why are your palms a different colour to the
    rest of you?" and questions of that nature. These are the kinds of things we may be
    able to excuse once we are older and reflecting. That being said let's take a moment
    to consider the impact in that given moment when you're still a child. Unfortunately,
    the pre-established innocence does not negate the fact that what's happening here is 
    the first instance of what can become a dangerous thought, if not managed properly 
    "I am not like them". As time goes on, depending on one's experiences, this can either
    be accepted as a simple fact of life or... this could be another root of a deep-seated
    shame. The latter being a tragically common path taken. This moment marks the 
    planting of the seed that is, the feeling of being othered, which left unchecked can
    become a harmful ideology. It's most likely that the child going through this has little
    to no idea the effect this is having on their subconscious mind.`,
    `Secondary school arrives. Of course, this is where the teen years begin and the
    majority of this pivotal time of your life is spent amongst your equally neurologically
    malleable peers. Let's assume the best-case scenario, you're an individual with an
    appreciation for your skin tone and your genetic makeup regardless of how unfamiliar
    you are with your culture. You will absolutely have this tested in ways you had not
    anticipated. Before now you did not know that you being black was something worth 
    paying so much attention to until you were forced to reach a level of hyper awareness.
    The class topic is slavery, eyes keep glancing over to you, civil rights lesson? the 
    same again. God forbid when discussing the poverty in Africa your teacher happens 
    to mention the country you and your family are from. But then comes the blatant
    racism. Any time a monkey is somehow presented to your class you prepare for a 
    comment or another snide look your way. A neanderthal, prehistoric human or simply
    anything brown, evoking the same response. You;re unequipped for this. You never 
    expected to have to deal with something like this. You do your best to not let this go
    without rebuttal but after so many repeats of the same scenario you learn to pick your
    battles. It never goes anywhere. Even the teachers seem to fail to take adequate
    action, they look uncomfortable having to deal with it and you can't help but be
    frustrated at their ineptitude.`,
    `Now although this is taking quite the toll, we can rest assured knowing it's not all bad. 
    You have friends, and frankly that helps a lot. However, even that's not without its 
    repercussions. They make it clear that what we had described as "childish innocence"
    isn't outgrown at the same pace as their preadolescence. That innocence is now 
    ignorance. You know they're not racist per se yet, it's painfully evident that they have
    spent a lifetime almost exlusively (in some casese 100% exclusively) surrounded by
    people who look like them and think like them. As result they walk through life with a 
    misplaced confidence in their problematic ways of thinking, so much so they have the
    audacity to tell you what is and isn't racist, what you should and shouldn't be offended
    by. You can attempt fighting your case but it's you on your own, against your entire
    social group of peers form the same demographic you are not a part of. The harder
    you push against their rhetoric the more you alienate yourself. You stand between two
    choices, a social life or scial activism. Understandably for your age you may choose 
    the social life. Being selective with what you dispute and simply disengaging with
    anything not worth your time. Decision you feel torn making, either way you will be
    unhappy.`,
      `The realisation that even your closest friends are capable of an ignorance you
    mistakenly thought they were above just by being in extended close proximity to you
    has led you to have some uncomfortable ideas on social dynamics in regard to both 
    race and possibly class if that also played role as it often does. Now the "othering"
    seed has been nurtured into a thriving plant in your psyche. You're yearning for a 
    sense of kinship, a type of understanding and belonging that needs to come from a
    source separate from your family. Your radical phase has been sparked. There's no 
    telling how long this lasts, it's different for everyone but one thing is for sure, it will
    remain present fo as long as it needs to. Around this same time you've reached the 
    height of your frustration and exhaustion from your poisonous over exposure to 
    ignorance. This will become one of manu life defining moments.
    `,
      `You have used leaving school as the perfect oppotunity to venture outside of your 
    previous social circle and instead find a community of people who share your 
    complexion. You never stayed for year thirteen, sixth form is over... College begins.
    During your time here your two closest friends are Nigerian and Bajan. You will feel
    seen in a new way. What you didn't expect was that you will be misunderstood in new 
    ways also. Not by the two friends previously mentioned but by the wider community
    that occupies your college. You are a new entity for them to behold. Someone with a 
    familiar skin but an unfamiliar character. They will categorise you the only way they
    know how eve if their conclusions are wildy inaccurate or ignorant in a way you've
    not yet encontered.`,
      `It's at this point where I intended to explain the experience of coming from a majority
    white area to majority black as black person yourself only to feel othered once 
    again. I would like to think that we are all familiar with the idea of being 'too black for
    the white kids, to white for the black kids' but sadly I feel it may still be a foreign
    concept to a large portion of people spanning all races. Still. Today's mission does not
    involve explaining this topic. It's simply not my prerogative at this moment. Instead, I 
    will give a brief outline of what this involves. The short of it is that there are 
    expectations placed on how you should behave and present yourself that will be
    pushed onto you by your peers that share your skin tone. This experience will make 
    it painfully clear how your environment affects what you believe you CAN be not to 
    mention who you should be. The idenity policing within black communities must be 
    dismantled. It's a sahme to say that this will fuel a sens of insecurity within you. It
    was one thing to feel too different from people you believed do not even look the
    same as you and from very different backgrouns but to have the people you 
    expected to only relate to make it clear you are also different from them creates an
    internal crisis you aren't aware of. All you know is this doesn't feel good and in fact in
    the worst-case scenario you may feel you are the problem. In reality it's unfair to 
    blame anyone, these expectations are built by what's familiar to people and their 
    capacity to accept something or someone that exist beyond those limits is
    dependant on factors outside of your control and for the most part, it's even outside 
    their own (but not entirely).`,
      `If you're lucky enough to be exposed to the right information and/or around the right
    people then somewhere in your life you will be able to process this with a healthy
    mind and reach a state where you no longer believe you can be othered in the way
    you previously had been. There are simply more types of people in the world than 
    the teenage you had been prepared for even in your immediate vicinity. Yes, you may 
    differ form some people in some ways, but that is an expected feature of life. There
    are people you have much in common with who will love you in new ways and annoy
    you in new ways also. The key is finding your identity by deciding it yourself. Relating
    to yourself first. Looking at your life with understanding and compassion because
    knowing why you are as well as who you are and accepting both will free you from the 
    shame you've carried as a result of believing you were to much of one thing and too
    little of something else. Allow the union black to remind you that you existing as you 
    do is not the problem. Shame, self hatred, discrimination and prejudice towards
    anyone are what we should be looking at with a critical eye.`,
      `So far we, have only discussed things from a microscopic lens. We've looked at
    interactions on a small scale but it must be said that there are also larger messages 
    constantly being received from society on multiple layers. There is media that 
    supports  the feeling you are too ethnic to truly feel a part of Britain and equally there
    is media that allows you to feel you are not enough of something else to truly feel
    you relate to other afro Caribbeans. It's an assault from all angles, brithing a
    frustration that desperately seeks to have every part of your identity handled with the
    respect it deserves. Many of us were born here, we undestand British references, we
    understand nuances in the English language only a native would understand, we
    have an appreciation for the dryness of British humour, and on Sunday we go to nans'
    for a roast. We are as deeply British as anyone who has spent as much time here as
    us yet even on the smallest scale of social interactions, we are made to feel othered 
    from the moment we are old enough to be aware. On the other side of that same coin
    we are proud of the genetics we have been blessed with. We are proud of every part
    of our heritage in the most intimate, soulful, spiritual, whatever word you'd like to use,
    way. We are proud and protective of our culture and history to a militant extent. This
    point cannont be overstated. 
    `,
      `For those of you who see yourself in anything discussed here please understand this,
    everything you have experienced has contributed towards your identity thus you are
    every aspect of that. It is acceptable to be a mixture of things that you are unable to
    find reflected in the people around you. Your life has been your own, you redefine the
    categories that you occupy, they do NOT define you. The way in which this presents
    in your character should be championed as a delightful and valid possibility. It's a 
    wonderful thing. There is no one way you should appear to the world. You are
    everything you and the people before you have lived, such a thing does not need to
    be understood by all, nor does it need explaining to those who do not understand. `,
